Partnerships and Grants

********
Overview
********

*Note, what follows are aspirational goals, not confirmed partnerships*

We see partnership both in terms of virtual space (through the decentralized internet and blockchain technology) and physical space, through alignment with nonprofits that share our vision and principles.

The goal is to approach identified partners (people, organizations, or open source platforms), mutually agree upon a project to fund, and move on to the next stage of project management and funding. All payments to recipient organizations will be in stable coin cryptocurrency (DAI or USDC).

=======================
Nonprofit Organizations
=======================

We welcome partnership with nonprofit organizations and inspiring thought leaders who share our vision.

TODO: Identify projects

Though being a good steward of the earth takes many forms, our primary focus is on water scarcity, deforestation, and the environmental impact of animal agriculture.

Grants

.. index:: ! Stable coins

*Currently unavailable. Check back soon for submission requirements for grant proposals.*

In addition to the Fugue Foundation :ref:`ref-platform`, we are working to award grants to nonprofit organizations that pursue projects aligned with our mission and charitable goals. These grants are awarded in cryptocurrency (using a stable coin such as DAI or USDC) through the FF Colony.

=========
FF Colony 
=========
.. index:: ! Colony.io
.. index:: ! Ethereum

Colony is a protocol for a new type of open, meritocratic organization that operates via software rather than paperwork and management hierarchy. A colony is a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that contains all of the normal functions of a traditional firm, as well as some new functions that are only possible using a decentralized platform. Using the functions built into Colony, an organization can do:

* Decision making
* Ownership
* Reputation
* Dispute resolution
* Work management and delegation
* Financial management

The smallest conceptual unit within a Colony is a task. A task is a discrete unit of work which requires no further subdivision or delegation, and which can be evaluated as complete or incomplete based on some set of criteria. Every task has three roles associated with it - Manager, Evaluator, Worker - which determine permissions for editing the task, submitting work, and ratings for performance.

* Decentralized blockchains are public ledgers and offer a unique blend of both transparency and privacy. The Fugue Foundation builds on the Ethereum blockchain.
* Truth, in this context, is cryptographic. For example, assertions are supported by a digital signature (non-repudiation), while deliverables are confirmed via a hash (data integrity).
* We are not in the data collection business and take privacy *very* seriously.
