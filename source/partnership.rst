Partnerships and Grants

Overview
********

Our strategy for establishing partnerships will broadly follow these steps in the near term:

1. Complete prototype of the Fugue Foundation charitable donation platform (dApp + API). See :ref:`ref-platform`.
2. Invite key individuals and organizations within the effective altruism (EA) community to virtual meet-ups to showcase the platform and provide valuable feedback for improvements.
3. Prepare a simple, concise presentation or one-pager to present to a subset of EA charity evaluators and some of their identified nonprofit orgs to onboard them into the platform. This will primarily entail having them securely setting up an Ethereum wallet address. Currently we have identified four such evaluators and twenty organizations.

==================
Charity Evaluators
==================
.. index:: ! Effective Altruism
.. index:: ! Charity Assessment

*Note, organizations listed are not official partners. We're just big fans.*

Charity assessment is the process of analysis of the "goodness" of a nonprofit organization in financial terms. Historically, charity evaluators have focused on the question of how much of contributed funds are used for the purpose(s) claimed by the charity, while more recently some evaluators have placed an emphasis on the cost effectiveness (or impact) of charities. The Fugue Foundation is presently following those assessments that utilize effective altruism criteria. We have identified four such evaluators for purposes of our dApp/API prototype.

* `Give Well <https://www.givewell.org>`_
* `80,000 Hours <https://80000hours.org>`_
* `The Life You Can Save <https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org>`_
* `Animal Charity Evaluators <https://animalcharityevaluators.org>`_

=======================
Nonprofit Organizations
=======================

*Note, organizations listed are not official partners. We're just big fans.*

Charity evaluators and researchers, such as those identified above, are of course working to find the nonprofit organizations that make the greatest impact for good in their respective domains. For purposes of limiting the scope of our efforts, below is the list of nonprofits (as having themselves been identified by a respective charity evaluator) that we have selected to include in our dApp and API prototype.

**Global poverty and Well-Being**: *Give Well*

* `SCI Foundation <https://schistosomiasiscontrolinitiative.org/>`_

====================
Open Source Projects
====================

All of our code is open source, so in that way anyone is free to participate in our efforts by making a pull request on one of our `Github repos <https://github.com/fuguefoundation/ff-api>`_. Below are just a few of the projects within the blockchain and open source communities that have captured our attention and imagination. We encourage you to check them out!

* `Gitcoin <https://gitcoin.co/>`_
* `Colony <https://colony.io/>`_
* `Giveth <https://giveth.io/>`_
* `Alice <https://alice.si/>`_
* `Ethereum Community Fund <https://ecf.network/>`_

Grants
******
.. index:: ! Stable coins
.. index:: ! Colony.io

*Currently in development. Check back for grant proposal submission requirements.*

In addition to the Fugue Foundation :ref:`ref-platform`, we are working to award grants to nonprofit organizations that pursue projects aligned with our mission and charitable goals. These grants are awarded in cryptocurrency (using a stable coin such as DAI or USDC) through the FF Colony.

=========
FF Colony 
=========
.. index:: ! Colony.io
.. index:: ! Ethereum

The FF Colony is the platform by which grants will be made available to qualified individuals and organizations. As noted above, this feature is still in development, but here is a little bit about what a blockchain based "colony" is and how we might leverage one to fund charitable projects.

`Colony <https://colony.io/>`_ is a protocol for a new type of open, meritocratic organization that operates via software rather than paperwork and management hierarchy. A colony is a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that contains all of the normal functions of a traditional firm, as well as some new functions that are only possible using a decentralized platform. Using the functions built into Colony, an organization can do:

* Decision making
* Ownership
* Reputation
* Dispute resolution
* Work management and delegation
* Financial management

The smallest conceptual unit within a Colony is a task, which for the Fugue Foundation would constitute the requirements of the grant. A task is a discrete unit of work which requires no further subdivision or delegation, and which can be evaluated as complete or incomplete based on some set of criteria. Every task has three roles associated with it - Manager, Evaluator, Worker - which determine permissions for editing the task, submitting work, and ratings for performance. The roles of the Manager and Evaluator are held by board members of the Fugue Foundation or possibly a respected third party, while the Worker is the person or organization fulfilling the grant.

Privacy and Data
****************
.. index:: ! Blockchain
.. index:: ! Ethereum

* We are not in the data collection business and take privacy *very* seriously. As we grow as a nonprofit organization, the Fugue Foundation looks forward to exploring potential changes within the legal structure of charitable donations with respect to donors and cryptocurrency.
* Decentralized blockchains are public ledgers and offer a unique blend of both transparency and privacy. The Fugue Foundation builds on the Ethereum blockchain.
* Truth, for us, is data driven and often comes in a cryptographic form. For example, assertions of identity are supported by a digital signature (non-repudiation), deliverables are confirmed via a hash (data integrity), and charities are chosen to receive donations because an evaluator has rigorously studied their financial records and track record in relation to their real world impact.
