Overview

*Note, what follows are aspirational goals, not confirmed partnerships*

The goal is to approach identified partners (people, organizations, or open source platforms), mutually agree upon a project to fund, and move on to the next stage of project management and funding. All payments to recipient organizations will be in stable coin cryptocurrency (DAI or USDC). The process will be documented as part of this book.

* We are not in the data collection business and take privacy *very* seriously.
* Truth, in this context, is cryptographic. For example, assertions are supported by a digital signature (non-repudiation), while deliverables are confirmed via a hash (data integrity).
* Decentralized blockchains are public ledgers and offer a unique blend of both transparency and privacy. The Fugue Foundation builds on the Ethereum blockchain.
