Working Title: *Altruism 2.0: A meta-guide for charity in a cryptic world*

This book is a 150 page work of nonfiction documenting charitable projects funded using cryptocurrency by the Fugue Foundation. These projects are run in partnership with notable thought leaders, activists, open source projects, and other nonprofit organizations. In addition to describing the goals and impact of each project, the book discusses the unique challenges and opportunites for establishing and managing a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to using decentralized blockchains as a primary means of administration and funding.  The book is also accompanied by an application and decentralized platform.  See :ref:`ref-platform`.

The book is divided up by the projects themselves. Though the exact details are to be determined, each project will receive substantial funding (in cryptocurrency) and relate to one of the following topics in conjunction with one or more partner (see :ref:`ref-partnership`). Partners listed are ideal candidates we have identified, though at this time no official partnership exists unless otherwise noted.

1.  Mindfulness and stoicism; working harder and taking personal responsibility (no excuses mentality)

2.  Women's empowerment; Freedom of thought and expression; Countering religious extremism

3.  Environmental stewardship (water scarcity, deforestation, and animal agriculture)

4.  Self-sovereignty (Open Source platforms such as Colony, GitCoin, Giveth, and Alice)

Each chapter will include a discussion as to subject matter, outline the nature of the project that was funded, and describe the impact. Additionally in a separate chapter and throughout when applicable, specific guidance on accomplishing these goals using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will be addressed. The intent here is to enable others (i.e., philanthropists, NGOs, nonprofits, etc.) to replicate these actions or integrate them into their organizations See :ref:`ref-chapters` for further synopsis.

********
Overview
********
.. index:: ! Decentralized Application
.. index:: ! Cryptocurrency

There are several unique characteristics of this book that make it appealing to both publishers and consumers.

1. As a "meta guide", the argumentation and discussion put forth leverages the work of other well-established authors and thought leaders to achieve its goals. We value breadth over depth, making information easily referenced and sourced for the reader. Nor do we seek to recreate the wheel, or assert claims better stated by a subject matter expert with whom we partner. See :ref:`ref-partnership` for further discussion.

2. In coordination with the nonprofit Fugue Foundation, a substantial amount of funds - in stable coin equivalent - will be used to fund the goals addressed in each chapter. The book is coupled with a decentralized application and platform as well to introduce unique functionality (such as reputation) into the discussion. See :ref:`ref-platform` for detailed information.

3. Due to the contrarian nature of some of the book's content, the fact that the book "puts its money where its mouth" means that its reception may be met with both intrigue and controversy. Read the :ref:`ref-chapters` for a content overview.

4. The author, in coordination with the Fugue Foundation, pledges to use any profits and proceeds from the publication of the book to further support the goals established therein.

**************
Marketing Plan
**************

1. **Write an amazing book**: There is no substitute for this. All the technology and monetary backing in the world can not make up for poor content, so the author's immediate focus is drawing out the central themes as described in the :ref:`ref-chapters`.
2. **Partner with affiliate organizations**: See :ref:`ref-partnership` strategy
3. **Build out decentralized application (dApp)**: This book and its incentives rely on a decentralized platform to manage certain transactions and reputation. See :ref:`ref-platform` for more information.
4. **Re-invest profits** or proceeds earned back into the project.
5. **Help other nonprofits learn from this model**: We believe that decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies will increasingly play a role in fundraising, donations, and a variety of transactions. This book is an effort to onboard people and organizations into this new system.

| Title: *Can't Hurt Me*
| Author: David Goggins
| Publisher: Goggins Built Not Born, LLC
| Published date: 12/4/2018
| ISBN-13 number: 978-1544512273
| Number of pages: 364
| Retail list price: $17.99

**Book description**: For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare — poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him “The Fittest (Real) Man in America.”

In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.

| Title: *Infidel*
| Author: Ayaan Hersi Ali
| Publisher: Atria Books
| Published date: 4/1/2008
| ISBN-13 number: 978-0743289696
| Number of pages: 384
| Retail list price: $17.28

**Book description**: One of today’s most admired and controversial political figures, Ayaan Hirsi Ali burst into international headlines following the murder of Theo van Gogh by an Islamist who threatened that she would be next. She made headlines again when she was stripped of her citizenship and resigned from the Dutch Parliament.

Infidel shows the coming of age of this distinguished political superstar and champion of free speech as well as the development of her beliefs, iron will, and extraordinary determination to fight injustice. Raised in a strict Muslim family, Hirsi Ali survived civil war, female mutilation, brutal beatings, adolescence as a devout believer during the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, and life in four troubled, unstable countries ruled largely by despots. She escaped from a forced marriage and sought asylum in the Netherlands, where she earned a college degree in political science, tried to help her tragically depressed sister adjust to the West, and fought for the rights of Muslim women and the reform of Islam as a member of Parliament. Under constant threat, demonized by reactionary Islamists and politicians, disowned by her father, and expelled from family and clan, she refuses to be silenced.

Ultimately a celebration of triumph over adversity, Hirsi Ali’s story tells how a bright little girl evolves out of dutiful obedience to become an outspoken, pioneering freedom fighter. As Western governments struggle to balance democratic ideals with religious pressures, no other book could be more timely or more significant.

| Title: *Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion*
| Author: Sam Harris
| Publisher: Simon & Schuster
| Published date: June 16, 2015
| ISBN-13 number: 978-1451636024
| Number of pages: 256 pages
| Retail list price: $14

**Book description**: For the millions of Americans who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris’s latest New York Times bestseller is a guide to meditation as a rational practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.

From Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history. Throughout this book, Harris argues that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow, and that how we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the quality of our lives.

Waking Up is part memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris—a scientist, philosopher, and famous skeptic—could write it.
