To have a productive conversation, we must first agree on terminology. Below are a list of key terms employed within the context and scope of the Fugue Foundation, and how we understand them.

.. index:: ! Application Programming Interface
.. _Application Programming Interface:

.. _Colony.io:
**Colony.io** - Colony is the people layer of the decentralised protocol stack –— an emerging collection of technologies built on Ethereum, which provide open, permissionless protocols for developers to create

labour, decision making, and financial management into their applications.

.. index:: ! Cryptocurrency
.. _Cryptocurrency:
**Cryptocurrency** - A digital asset designed as a medium of exchange using blockchain technology. Although there are hundreds of such currencies, as of this writing the Fugue Foundation is primarily interested in Ether (ETH), ERC-20 stable coins such as DAI and USDC, and Bitcoin (BTC).
