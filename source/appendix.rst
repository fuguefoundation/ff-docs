To have a productive conversation, we must first agree on terminology. Below are a list of key terms employed within the context and scope of the Fugue Foundation, and how we understand them.

.. index:: ! Application Programming Interface
.. _Application Programming Interface:
**Application Programming Interface (API)** - An interface specific to an application allowing third parties to access certain data resources. It abstracts the underlying implementation (such as a dataset) and exposes objects or actions that a developer may need.

.. index:: ! Blockchain
.. _Blockchain:
**Blockchain** - A public, decentralized, permission-ledger distributed across a peer-to-peer network and validated by a consensus algorithm. The Fugue Foundation develops on the Ethereum blockchain.

.. index:: ! Colony.io
.. _Colony.io:
**Colony.io** - Colony is the people layer of the decentralised protocol stack –— an emerging collection of technologies built on Ethereum, which provide open, permissionless protocols for developers to create
sophisticated products without having to build complex backend software. The Colony Protocol allows developers to integrate decentralised and self regulating division of
labour, decision making, and financial management into their applications.

.. index:: ! Cryptocurrency
.. _Cryptocurrency:
**Cryptocurrency** - A digital asset designed as a medium of exchange using blockchain technology. Although there are hundreds of such currencies, as of this writing the Fugue Foundation is primarily interested in Ether (ETH), ERC-20 stable coins such as DAI and USDC, and Bitcoin (BTC).

.. index:: ! Decentralized Application
.. _Decentralized Application:
**Decentralized Application (dApp)** - An internet-based application (frontend) that interfaces with a blockchain (backend) and is capable of generating valid transactions to make state changes.

.. index:: ! Decentralized Autonomous Organization
.. _Decentralized Autonomous Organization:
**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** - An organization represented by rules encoded within a smart contract and controlled by shareholders of a digital asset (token) and not influenced by a central authority.

.. index:: ! Effective Altruism
.. _Effective Altruism:
**Effective Altruism** - The act of considering evidence and analysis to determine how we can effectively use resources to help others the most.

.. index:: ! Non-fungible Token
.. _Non-fungible Token:
**Non-fungible Token** - Based off the ERC721 specification, it is a crytographically unique, mutually non-interchangeable token.

.. index:: ! Smart contract
.. _Smart contract:
**Smart contract** - A collection of code and data with a specific purpose or capability that resides at an address on a blockchain. The Fugue Foundation develops smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

.. index:: ! Stable coins
.. _Stable coins:
**Stable coins** - A cryptocurrency that is pegged to another more stable asset, like gold or the U.S. dollar. DAI and USDC are examples of a stable coin.

.. index:: ! United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
