In addition to the Fugue Foundation :ref:`ref-platform`, we are working to award grants to nonprofit organizations that pursue projects aligned with our mission and charitable goals. These grants are awarded in cryptocurrency (using a stable coin such as DAI or USDC) through the FF Colony.

FF Colony 
*********

Colony is a protocol for a new type of open, meritocratic organization that operates via software rather than paperwork and management hierarchy. A colony is a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that contains all of the normal functions of a traditional firm, as well as some new functions that are only possible using a decentralized platform. Using the functions built into Colony, an organization can do:

* Decision making
* Ownership
* Reputation
* Dispute resolution
* Work management and delegation
* Financial management

The smallest conceptual unit within a Colony is a task. A task is a discrete unit of work which requires no further subdivision or delegation, and which can be evaluated as complete or incomplete based on some set of criteria. Every task has three roles associated with it - Manager, Evaluator, Worker - which determine permissions for editing the task, submitting work, and ratings for performance.
