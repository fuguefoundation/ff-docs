Chapter 1: Do more
******************

==============
*Momento Mori*
==============

- Exhibition: The Stoic philosophy
- Do more. Two simple words, and a universe of variety between them. Do what? More of what?  Do more. The world does not care about your excuses. If you take nothing else from this book, take that. It is a truth that tastes bitter at first, but is liberating when swallowed. I've always been surprised by this most human of tendencies, to make excuses. Examples. All of these alibis may explain the consequences of now, but do they real excuse them? And does it even matter in the eyes of the other person(s), organization,

Chapter 2: Thinking for Oneself
*******************************

We assert that one of the greatest gifts a parent can give a child is the ability to think for him or herself. And yet, the whole world over, not only is this an uncommon generational endowment, the opposite is frequently the case.

This is a controversial chapter because it encourages people to think for themselves, something that the ubiquitous "they" discourage. And we all know who "they" are: Parents and governments, teachers and friends and religious leaders; "they" can be anyone who values conformity and submission over personal autonomy and the free exchange of ideas.

Before taking what follows out of context, let's give the bottomline up front. Believe what you want, however absurd, however grounded in logic and reason or faith and lore, but understand *why* you believe it. If nothing else, this will make you a better adherent to the belief. When asked why you believe or believe in something, be prepared to defend yourself in a way that withstands scrutiny, does not make appeals to authority, and perhaps even welcomes criticism. So, knowing where this argument is headed, we will unpack it through three examples seen among the numinous.

========
Apostacy
========

1. Birth

- Children are born in to conditions beyond their control (i.e., rich or poor family, which particular country, genetic endowment, etc.) [#f1]_
- Children, being the most vulnerable human creatures on the planet, are entirely reliant on their caretakers for survival.
- The neuroplasticity of young children with normal cognitive abilities is incredibly malleable and under continual development.
- Young children will unconditionally accept the belief structure of the parental and ambient community,that is, the people they know and trust the most. This is tantamount ot indoctrination and inculcation.

2. Adolescence and Adulthood

- Eventually, the child will grow up and encounter a thought that contradicts or fails to conform to their worldview.
- Discuss the ways that households and communities insolate themselves to try and prevent the infiltration of such thoughts that run contrary to their belief structures.
- Discuss examples of how households and communities will shun or even punish (i.e., honor killings) those who dare to think for themselves on the topic of what religion they choose to follow or not follow.

3. The State

- There are 13 countries in the world where apostacy is punishable by death, all of which are majority Muslim. There are many more countries where blasphemy is punishable by fines, floggings, and incarceration.
- Discuss how apostacy is essentially a type of thought crime in the eyes of these States and those people who agree with the severity of this "crime."

==============================
The problem with the hereafter
==============================

In order to save the world, we first have to believe the world is worth saving and that mortal man is capable of doing so.

1. Heaven

- Explore the idea of seeing this life as some type of test, mortgaging temporal time on earth for the sake of an eternal life to come. This inhibits investment in improving daily life
- The comfort heaven has in the face of death causes people not to properly reflect upon the inevitability of death (momento mori).
- The schadenfreude of apocolyspe
- Others (parents) approving whether you go to heaven or not

2. Hell

- Unpack the psychological implications of how belief in hell impacts one's perception of the people on the planet. There are certain conditions for avoiding this fate, and many people - perhaps the majority of the world population, depending on the faith - will ultimately not be saved because they do meet these conditions.
- Discuss the apparent contradiction of hell with a god that is both just omnipotent and omnibenevolent. Discuss the lack of mercy and injustice of an infinite punishment for a finite crime.

3. Solipsism

- Believing that you have some privileged place in the grand scheme of the universe
- Building upon the sections on heaven and hell, discuss the problem of solipsism and how people are capable of essentially dismissing the existence of large swathes of the population. At a sub conscious level, if you do not regard them as actually alive, in terms of how their life has any impact upon your own day to day existence, it is easier to reconcile personal beliefs with their "logical" conclusions.

===========================
*Infidel* by Ayaan Hirsi Ali
===========================

- Exposition of central arguments

====================
Empowerment of women
====================

1. Women represent 50% of the population.

- How far can a society expect to advance by marginalizing half its people then leaving these women to raise the other half, thereby subtly imparting this aquiesence on their sons.

2. Abuse (inflicted or tolerated in the name of god)

- Forced marriage
- Veiling - From coercive social pressures to physical violence for not wearing it
- Spousal abuse (physical and mental)
- Treating women as brood mares, only there for birthing and rearing children
- Female genital mutilation

3. Apologists (treating religion as beyond reproach)

- Religious scholars
- Apologists in the wake of a disaster ("this is not the right time to discuss this")
- Feminist apologists

Chapter 3: Life, whatever it may be
***********************************

This chapter tackles the question of environmentalism and stewardship of the earth. It addresses the problem somewhat obliquely, by speaking to points that are often overlooked and misunderstood.

==============
Water Scarcity
==============

- Exhibition: The importance of water for life, juxtaposed with its (despite appearances) relative scarcity
- The inevitability of wars being fought over this resource. Arguably this is happening today. Examples may include the Syrian refugee crisis, China and its control of Tibet, and others.
- Relate to rising populations: overview of the current state and projected figures of world population. Establish a goal of creating a context or framework to discuss this issue. Topic is linked to women's empowerment, religious fundamentalism (i.e., peopling the earth), and scarcity of resources.

=============
Deforestation
=============

- Exhibition

==================
Animal Agriculture
==================

- Exhibition: link animal agriculture to environmental impact (carbon emmission, water contamination, deforestation, etc.)
- Argument from compassion - Breaking free from a system of violence, one on which future generations will likely look back with shame and appal.
- Argument from health - Brief discussion. Again, the focus here is about getting people to become more aware of the impact their choices have.

Gitcoin - "A New Hope for Open Source Sustainability" : Ethereal Summit 2019 - Kevin Owocki
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2yeOFlRE0E

Impact of open source software
- Why should you care? Sustainability?
- Depends on the industry, average of 57% of code being from open source software
- How many dollars of economic value created from open source?

What motivates one to contribute to OSS?
- personal hobby, enjoy learning, altruistic, cultural reasons
- extrinsic (Github)

Problem
- Heartbleed (Open SSL)
- Choosing beggars, expecting result from repos
- 65% of OSS projects have a "truck factor" of lt= 2
- most people use OSS, few contribute to it
- 200-900B of marketcap in crypto market, everyone needs devs

Attempts at solutions
- donation buttons
- requesting funding from cloud providers

Solutions
- Gitcoin Grants (decentralized Patreon)
- MolochDAO
- Micro donations
- Block rewards funding

Conclusion
**********

- Discussion of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology
- The ability to power up a computer anywhere in the world and transfer a finitely scarce resource to any other individual, without permission or reliance on a trusted third-party is empowering. That hundreds of millions of people can do this in unison without anyone needing to trust other participants in the network is near-impossible to fully comprehend.
- "The problem is precisely how to extend the span of our utilization of resources beyond the span of the control of any one mind; and therefore, how to dispense with the need of conscious control, and how to provide inducements which will make the individuals do the desirable things without anyone having to tell them what to do (Hayek - The Use of Knowledge in Society)
