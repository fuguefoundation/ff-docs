Strategic Goals
***************

* One of the greatest and most sustainable way to help a person is to enable them to help themselves. Education and knowledge are among the most effective ways to achieve this type of empowerment and self-reliance. One of the best methodologies to achieve this is to teach people *how* to think, not *what* to think. We see mindfulness meditation, stoic philosophy, and a hard work, no excuses mentality as primary vehicles for getting there.

* We believe that everybody succeeds when women are empowered as individuals to make choices over their own lives, to access opportunities without facing obstacles imposed on them through religious extremism.

* There is only one planet and it has finite resources. We all need air to breath and water to drink, the cleaner the better. Yet more and more trees are cut down each day, potable water grows increasingly scare, and few people appreciate the role that animal agriculutre factors into this equation. We seek to fund programs and projects combatting against these threats.

* Almost 50% of the world's population lives on less than 2.50 USD per day. There are many complicated reasons for this - economics, over-population, lack of quality education, epidemic diseases, environmental problems - but at the root of it lies a question of employment. We believe that the development and administration of blockchain-based technology will be a key resource and value distribution mechanism for tomorrow's workforce. It is imperative to help onboard organizations and users alike into this new digital economy. But to get there, and to bring everyone along for the ride, it will take more than awareness, training, and determination. It will take practical applications for the technology itself to prove its utility, along with a new generation of developers with the necessary skillset to support and innovate these apps, filling a void where current solutions prove ineffective or insufficient.

*Fugue Foundation is a private foundation and is presently not seeking public donation.*

* See :ref:`ref-platform` to see some of the open source projects we are developing.
* Decentralized finance and governance models through blockchain technology are cutting edge resources that enable personal liberty and self-sovereignty. The Fugue Foundation will utilize these tools whenever possible.
* Books, and memoirs from living authors in particular, will be a critical educational use case for the Fugue Foundation decentralized application (dApp). Memoirs by authors that are relatable from the perspective of the reader, that portray stories of triumph over adversity and present solutions for future action at various levels of engagement are our first target. See :ref:`ref-partnership`
* Self-organizing principles
